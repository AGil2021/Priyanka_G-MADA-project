  abstract = "The COVID-19 pandemic has disproportionately impacted Americans
              in socially vulnerable areas. Unfortunately, these groups are
              also experiencing lower vaccination rates. To understand how
              strategic vaccine site placement may benefit high vulnerability
              populations, we extracted vaccine site locations for 26 U.S.
              states and linked these data to county-level adult vaccination
              rates and the CDC 2018 Social Vulnerability Index rankings. We
              fit quasi-Poisson regression models to compare vaccine site
              density between the highest and lowest SVI domain quartiles, and
              assessed whether greater vaccine site density mediated or
              modified the relationship between social vulnerability and
              vaccination rates. We found that high vulnerability counties by
              socioeconomic status had more vaccine sites per 10,000 residents,
              yet this higher vaccine site density did not reduce socioeconomic
              disparities in vaccination rates. Persistent vaccination
              inequities may reflect other structural barriers to access. Our
              results suggest that targeted vaccine site placement in high
              vulnerability counties may be necessary but insufficient for the
              goal of widespread, equitable vaccination.",
